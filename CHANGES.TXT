The major number changes for such things as code rewrites, changes in
syntax, and/or dramatic changes in functionality. The minor number
changes for corrections, enhancements, etc. made to the code. There
is no set schedule for releases.


--0.4.1--

   !	MANIFEST.TXT.in: remove reference material related more to
	implementation of a Forth system as opposed to the Forth
	language.

   !	Fixed words: ELSE BLANK.

   !	Renamed p4IntegerToString to p4SignedToString

   !	Fixed REFILL / EVALUATION interaction.

   !	Renamed the size of a cell constant CELL to /CELL.

   !	Switched from using the return stack for compilation stack to
	using the data stack for everything except colon definitions.
	Almost all the compilation, especially with the pre-defined
	words was greatly simplified as there was no longer need to
	pay special attention to caller's return address while
	manipulating things like do-sys, loop-sys, dest, orig, etc.

	Colon definitions are currently handled specially through the
	P4_Context ->word and ->xt members and not on any stack. This
	should be revisited to see if implementing "colon-sys" on the
	data stack simplifies the code.

   !	Fixed implementation of TO.

   +	Added p4UnsignedToString.

   +	Added words U. U< +! VALUE TO NIP TUCK WITH-IN WITH-OUT CONTEXT
	RS-PICK RS-ROLL ?DO DO LOOP +LOOP LEAVE UNLOOP I J EXIT MARKER
	.# U.# 'SEE SLEEP

--0.4.0--

   !	Complete overhaul of threading model and source code to function
	better in C and with a view towards post4 becoming an embedded
	object oriented threaded scripting language.

--0.1--

   +	Initial indirect threaded version.
