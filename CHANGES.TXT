-------

The major number changes for such things as code rewrites, changes in
syntax, and/or dramatic changes in functionality. The minor number
changes for corrections, enhancements, etc. made to the code. There
is no set schedule for releases.

--TODO--

   +	Add means to pass command line arguments into a context.

   +	Add File word sets.

   +	SLITERAL null terminate the stored word. Allows for
   	intermixing with C string functions.

--0.4.3--

   !	Fixed KEY to modify and restore termios settings so as to get
	single unbuffered and non-echoed input character.

   !	Changed command line option to require -f to evaluate a source
   	file, instead of passing as an argument. This allows for a
   	script to get command line arguments; similar to behaviour of
   	awk and sed.

   !	Overhauled once more the setjmp/longjmp to simplify the code.
	Suspect this can be refactored once more later merging on_abort
	and on_throw jump buffers.

   + 	Added special (hack) case for Unix command line pipe filters
	allows us to say:

		... | post4 -f script | ...

	If the last line of the source file ends with:

		QUIT last_word\n<eof>

	Then we throw to a special version of QUIT that will restore
	standard input and parses the last word in the parse area
	_before_ resetting >IN to zero.

	It is up to the word executed to wait for SIGPIPE, terminate the
	process with <exit-code> BYE, or fall through to the interactive
	interpreter.

   +	Also added START word as a more clear extension to the special
   	QUIT last_word hack above.

   +	Added words AT-XY PAGE TIME&DATE INCLUDE BLOCK BUFFER LOAD LIST
	LIST+ SCR THRU UPDATE USE USING EMPTY-BUFFERS SAVE-BUFFERS FLUSH
	?BLOCKS UPDATED?

   !	Fixed bug with LEAVE not taking into account an IF...THEN context,
   	ie.   DO ... IF ... LEAVE THEN ... LOOP

   !	Replaced SLEEP with MS.

   !	Replaced .# and U.# with .R and U.R. .# and U.# are just right
   	justified numbers in a zero width field.

   +	Added numeric prefix parsing support:

   		$7F		hex
   		0x7F		hex
   		0X7F		hex
   		0377		octal
   		#999		decimal
   		%101010		binary
   		\n		backslash escape
   		'c'		character

   !	Replaced IBASE and OBASE with the standard BASE word.

   !	Fixed implementation of >=

   +	Added examples/ed.p4; collection of words for block editing with
   	simple line mode style similar to ed(1), interactive single line
   	editing, and interactive full "screen" editing.

--0.4.2--

   !	Changed ( and .( to allow for comments/strings that span
   	multiple input lines as mentioned in ANS-Forth 1994 section
   	11.6.1.0080.

   !	Changed semantics of S" to support ANS-Forth 1994 section
   	11.6.1.2165.

   !	Fixed p4GetLine() to correctly handle zero length buffer.

   !	Move P4_Context.source_id to P4_Input.fd. This makes it all
   	part of the input source context and simplifies save/restore
   	of this context.

   !	Cleaned up the handling of setjmp buffers in p4EvalFile(),
   	p4EvalString(), etc. to allow for nesting.

   +	Added BLK, INCLUDED, ?DUP, SPACES.

--0.4.1--

   !	MANIFEST.TXT.in: remove reference material related more to
	implementation of a Forth system as opposed to the Forth
	language.

   !	Fixed words: ELSE BLANK.

   !	Renamed p4IntegerToString to p4SignedToString

   !	Fixed REFILL / EVALUATION interaction.

   !	Renamed the size of a cell constant CELL to /CELL.

   !	Switched from using the return stack for compilation stack to
	using the data stack for everything except colon definitions.
	Almost all the compilation, especially with the pre-defined
	words was greatly simplified as there was no longer need to
	pay special attention to caller's return address while
	manipulating things like do-sys, loop-sys, dest, orig, etc.

	Colon definitions are currently handled specially through the
	P4_Context ->word and ->xt members and not on any stack. This
	should be revisited to see if implementing "colon-sys" on the
	data stack simplifies the code.

   !	Fixed implementation of TO.

   +	Added p4UnsignedToString.

   +	Added words U. U< +! VALUE TO NIP TUCK WITH-IN WITH-OUT CONTEXT
	RS-PICK RS-ROLL ?DO DO LOOP +LOOP LEAVE UNLOOP I J EXIT MARKER
	.# U.# 'SEE SLEEP

--0.4.0--

   !	Complete overhaul of threading model and source code to function
	better in C and with a view towards post4 becoming an embedded
	object oriented threaded scripting language.

--0.1--

   +	Initial indirect threaded version.
