Security Policy
===============

Only the most recent tagged release is being supported with security updates.  To determine the version of your build:

        $ post4 -V

Supply those details, especially the `COMMIT` tag, with your report.  The other details may be relevant to the report, so please include them.

Any security vulnerability serious enough to require private communications, please contact directly using OpenPGP:
