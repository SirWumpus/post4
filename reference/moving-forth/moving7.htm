<h2 align="center">Part 7: CamelForth for the 8051</h2>

<h3 align="center">by Brad Rodriguez</h3>

<p><font size="-1">This article first appeared in <a href="http://www.psyber.com/%7Etcj">The
Computer Journal</a> #71 (January/February 1995).</font></p>

<p>Under the prodding of Our Esteemed Editor, I present CamelForth for
the 8051. CamelForth for the 6809 will follow soon! This 8051 Forth occupies
about 6K of program memory. Alas, the full source listing would take 16
pages of TCJ, so this article includes only the significantly changed portions
of the kernel. <i>[Note for web publication: see the end of this page for
a link to the 8051 source code.] </i>These should illustrate how the high-level
code is modified for the 8051 assembler, and for subroutine threading.
The full source code is available in the Forth Roundtable on GEnie as file
CAMEL51.ZIP, and the freeware 8051 assembler as file A51.ZIP. But first...
</p>

<h2>Z80 ERRATA </h2>

<p>In the file CAMEL80H.AZM, the definition of DO is given as </p>

<pre>  ['] xdo ,BRANCH  . . . </pre>

<p>It should be </p>

<pre>  ['] xdo ,XT  . . . </pre>

<p>This is of no consequence on the Z80 (where ,BRANCH and ,XT are identical),
but it became embarassingly obvious on the 8051. </p>

<p>Also, in the words S" and (S"), the word ALIGN should really
be ALIGNED. On the Z80 -- and the 8051 -- both are no-ops, so this mistake
didn't make itself evident. </p>

<h2>8051 CAMELFORTH MODEL </h2>

<p>In issue #60 I summarized the design decisions for an 8051 Forth. To
recap: the 8051's retarded memory addressing practically demands the use
of subroutine threading. This means the hardware stack (in the 8051 register
file) is the Return Stack. The Parameter Stack (a.k.a. Data Stack) is in
256 bytes of external RAM, using R0 as the stack pointer. Since that article,
I've discovered that it's better to keep the Top Of Stack item (TOS) in
DPTR than in R3:R2. Thus: </p>

</tbody></table>

<p>This incorporates an idea from Charles Curley [CUR93]. On a register-rich
machine like the 8051, we can keep the innermost loop index in registers.
This makes LOOP and +LOOP much faster. DO must still push two values on
the Return Stack: the <i>old</i> loop index, and the <i>new</i> loop limit!
UNLOOP must of course restore the loop index from the Return Stack -- kudos
to the ANSI team for making UNLOOP a distinct word! Note that R6:R7 are
<i>not</i> the topmost Return Stack item, merely the innermost loop index.
</p>

<p>Port 2 (P2) contains the high byte of the Parameter Stack Pointer (allowing
R0 to address external memory), which is also the high byte of the User
Pointer -- the low byte of UP is assumed to be 00. I learned the hard way
that P2 can't be read while executing from external ROM, so I keep a copy
of the P2 byte in register 8. </p>

<p>I have a novel implementation of BRANCH and ?BRANCH. Since the 8051
model is subroutine-threaded, high-level Forth is compiled as true machine
code. So BRANCH can be implemented with an SJMP (or AJMP or LJMP) instruction.
?BRANCH can be implemented with a JZ instruction, <i>if</i> the zero/nonzero
status of the top-of-stack is put in the accumulator (A register). The
subroutine ZEROSENSE does this. So, BRANCH and ?BRANCH become </p>

<pre>BRANCH:   SJMP dest 
?BRANCH:  LCALL ZEROSENSE JZ dest 
</pre>

<p>Similar routines LOOPSENSE and PLUSLOOPSENSE allow a JZ instruction
to be used for LOOP and +LOOP. For these, a call to UNLOOP must appear
after the JZ, to clean up the Return Stack when the program "falls
out" of the loop. </p>

<p>In the assembly language source file I have manually replaced the sequence
</p>

<pre>  LCALL word   RET </pre>

<p>with the shorter and faster </p>

<pre>  LJMP word </pre>

<p>in many places [CUR93]. This works as long as "word" isn't
a return-stack operator (such as R&gt; or &gt;R). LCALL and LJMP have also
been replaced with ACALL and AJMP where possible. The CamelForth compiler
does <i>not</i> attempt these optimizations. </p>

<p>I wrote the 8051 kernel to use "Intel" byte order (low byte
first). Then I discovered that the address compiled into an LJMP or LCALL
is stored <i>high</i> byte first. Rather than rewrite the entire kernel,
I included a byte-swap in those words which compile LCALLs: COMPILE, !CF
and ,CF (all in the Dependency word set). </p>

<p>Listing 1 gives the 8051 assembly language "primitives", and
Listing 2 gives the Dependency word set. </p>

<h2>HARVARD ARCHITECTURES </h2>

<p>The 8051 uses a "Harvard" architecture: program and data are
kept in separate memories. In embedded systems, these are typically ROM
and RAM, respectively. ANS Forth is the first Forth standard to address
the restrictions of a Harvard architecture. Briefly, ANS Forth says that
a) application programs can only access Data memory, and b) all of the
operators used to access memory and build data structures must operate
in Data space. (Ref. section 3.3.3 of the ANS document [ANS94].) This includes
the Forth words </p>

<p>@ ! C@ C! DP HERE ALLOT , C, COUNT TYPE WORD (S") S" CMOVE
</p>

<p>Yet the Forth compiler still needs to access Program space (also called
Code or Instruction space). And Forth needs to maintain a dictionary pointer
for Program space as well as Data space. So I've added these new words
(shown in Listing 3): </p>

<p>I@ I! IC@ IC! IDP IHERE IALLOT I, IC, ICOUNT ITYPE IWORD (IS")
IS" D-&gt;I I-&gt;D </p>

<p>The "I" prefix stands for "Instruction" (since "P"
and "C" have other meanings in Forth). ICOUNT and ITYPE are needed
to display strings which have been compiled into ROM. IWORD copies the
string left by WORD from Data space to Code space -- needed to build Forth
word headers and ROMmed strings. D-&gt;I and I-&gt;D are equivalents of
CMOVE, which copy to and from Code space. </p>

<p>VARIABLEs must have addresses in Data space. So they can't use the traditional
practice of putting the data immediately after the Code field. Instead,
the <i>Data space address</i> of the data is stored after the Code field.
In essence, a VARIABLE is a CONSTANT whose value is the Data space address.
(Note that the traditional CONSTANT is still valid.) </p>

<p>CREATEd words, and words built with CREATE...DOES&gt;, must work the
same way. Here's how they look in Program space: </p>

<pre>CODE word:   ...header... 8051 machine code 
high-level:  ...header... 8051 machine code 
CONSTANT:    ...header... LCALL-DOCON  value 
VARIABLE:    ...header... LCALL-DOCON  Data-adrs 
CREATEd:     ...header... LCALL-DOCON  Data-adrs 
</pre>

<p>Note that CONSTANT must replace the value stored by CREATE, and : must
"un-allot" both this value and the LCALL DOCON. </p>

<p>S" presents special problems. Strings defined with S" ("text
literals") must reside in Data space, where they can be used by such
words as TYPE and EVALUATE. But we expect those strings to be part of a
definition, and to exist in ROM in a ROM forth environment. We could store
the string in Program space, and copy it to HERE when referenced, but the
ANS document does not allow text literals to exist in this "transient"
storage region (ref. sections 3.3.3.4 and 3.3.3.6 [ANS93]). Also, if WORD
returns its string at HERE -- as in CamelForth -- text literals must not
alter this transient region. </p>

<p>My solution is to have S" <i>store</i> the string in Code space,
but permanently reserve space for it in Data space, and copy it from Code
to Data when referenced. ANS Forth does not yet fully address the problems
of Harvard processors; something like C's "initialized data"
region may eventually be required. </p>

<p>Since ." strings can never be accessed by the programmer, they
<i>can</i> be stored in Code space, using the words (IS") and IS".
(These are the "old" (S") and S".) This adds two words
to the kernel, but saves quite a bit of Data space. I plan to move the
string-literal words into either the Dependency word set, or a new "Harvard"
word set. </p>

<h2>WRITING TO PROGRAM SPACE </h2>

<p>The 8051 can't actually write to Program memory. There's no hardware
signal for this, and no machine instruction. Under these circumstances,
the CamelForth <i>interpreter</i> will work, but new words can't be compiled.
You can get around this by causing some memory to appear in <i>both</i>
Program and Data space. Figure 1 shows the modification to my board, an
MCB8031 from Blue Ridge Micros (2505 Plymouth Road, Johnson City, TN, 37601,
USA, telephone 615-335-6696, fax 615-929-3164). U1A and U1B create a new
read strobe which is active for <i>either</i> a Program or Data fetch.
EPROM is selected only when A15 is low (lower 32K), and RAM when A15 is
high (upper 32K). You still can't write to EPROM, of course, but you <i>can</i>
execute programs out of RAM! One disadvantage: this makes @ and I@ equivalent,
so it's not immediately obvious if the wrong one was used somewhere. </p>

<h2>NEXT ISSUE... </h2>

<p>These modifications to the CamelForth high-level code are intended to
be portable to <i>either</i> Harvard or non-Harvard ("von Neumann")
machines. For the latter, the new Program-space words are simply equated
to their Data-space equivalents, e.g. on the Z80, </p>

<p>IFETCH EQU FETCH <br>
ISTORE EQU STORE <br>
ITYPE EQU TYPE <br>
etc. </p>

<p>In the next installment I shall modify the <i>8051</i> source code to
work on the 6809...thus approaching a truly portable model by successive
approximation. </p>
